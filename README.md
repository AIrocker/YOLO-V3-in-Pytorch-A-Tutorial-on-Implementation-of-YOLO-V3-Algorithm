# Tutorial-on-Implementation-of-YOLO-V3-in-Pytorch

## Overview 

Reading codes with little comments or help document could be a hugh headache especially for most new-entry deep learning reserach engineers. This repo is projected to offer a tutorial on how to implement YOLO_V3, one of the state of art deep learning algorithms for object detection. 

In this work, the YOLO_V3 algorithm is trained from stratch using Pascal VOC dataset for demonstration purpose. Hopefully, after reading this tutorial, developers can build and train their own YOLO network using other datasets for various object detection tasks

## Installation 

### Environment 
* pytorch >= 1.0.0
* python >= 3.6.0
